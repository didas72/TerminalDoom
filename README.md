# TerminalDoom

TerminalDoom shoudl probably be called TerminalWolfenstein. It is a small program that renders Wolfenstein style walls on a console screen.
It only works on 60x60 console screen, and it flickers a bit, depending on the system running it.

I was originally going to attempt to make a small game with it but later abandoned the project.
